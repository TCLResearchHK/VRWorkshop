A VR workshop organized for the Department of Media and Communication, City University of Hong Kong.

## Abstract

We will have hands on experience in creating VR applications using different tools. We will create an interior enviroment (read: a small room) twice, first using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), and then using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

Firstly, we will model the room with [Sweet Home 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/). [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) will be used for modifying the 3D models.

Secondly, we will turn the room model into a desktop application using Unity. The resulting application can be viewed on desktop. We will also demostrate what is needed to be done to make it runs in [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/), though due to time and hardware limitation, students will only develop a non-VR version.

Finally, we will create a WebVR web page to display the room model using A-Frame. The resulting page can be visited on desktop browsers in 3D, and, on mobile browsers in VR with the help of [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/).

## Preparation

Download and install the softwares as follows:

 * [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)
   personal edition, version 5.5.x or up.

    * During installation, select 64-bit (32-bit is also fine), choose components including "Unity 5.5.x", "Documentation", "Standard Assets".

    * We don't plan to build native Android / iOS apps, so leave those components as unchecked.
